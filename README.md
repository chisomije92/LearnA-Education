## Getting Started

Once you have the prerequisites in place, you can start LearnA locally by following these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chisomije92/learNA-Education.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your current working directory to the project's root folder:

```sh
cd learnA-Education
```

3. Start it locally by clicking **Open with Live Server** when you click on the index.html file

4. Your default web browser should automatically open with the live version of your index.html file. You can now start editing your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in VS Code, and the changes will be automatically reflected in the browser thanks to Live Server.
